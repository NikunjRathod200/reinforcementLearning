# Reinforcement learning
Abstract â€“ Reinforcement Learning is somewhat similar to Machine
Learning but different from the supervised learning where the
model is trained from the labeled dataset. Reinforcement
Learning includes Agent, Action and Environment. Here,
agent is the user in the Environment and taking some actions
and based on the actions, agent gets a numerical reward.
Based on the rewards it gets, the agent learns if the action was
worth taking or not. The reward is the kind of feedback to the
user (here agent). The reward can be positive or negative. If
the reward is positive, it means it is beneficial to the user and
the action it has taken in good to take in future. But if the user
gets negative reward, it means the action taken was not so
good and user will avoid taking that action in the future. The
ultimate goal of the system is to maximize the future reward.
